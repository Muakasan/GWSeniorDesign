						<strong>Snooze-Get The Best Sleep Ever:</strong>
						Snooze is a sleep monitoring device designed to detect and record patient gestures during sleep. It uses machine learning to recognize the gestures and displays a user-friendly informative summary of the nightâ€™s events. Snooze is powered by nothing more than a 3D infrared camera more specifically the Kinect sensor and a computer. <br><br>

						<strong>Bio:</strong>
						ArticleSense is a suggested reading tool that helps supplement knowledge. Unlike tradition search engines, ArticleSense takes an article one might be currently reading and figures out what the keywords are and finds similar articles. The program reads the article and finds the keywords, and then calculates the most relevant articles. It chooses the top ten most relevant articles and presents it to the user. ArticleSense uses a machine learning algorithm to better find the keywords and topics in a particular article. Also, the user has the ability to rate the results they get, in order to get better results in the future.					</p>
