						<strong>BrowseFS-Mkdir, Ls, Cd The Web With BrowseFS:</strong>
						My project, titled “BrowseFS”, is intended to provide a new interface for users to surf the web through a user-space file system. This new interface will be controlled using overloaded versions of some common Unix directory navigation commands (e.g. “cd”, “mkdir”, “ls”, etc). It is expected that this new interface will provide power users with many new ways to automate and script web browsing tasks.
