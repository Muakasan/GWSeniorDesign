						<strong>Composite-Building Robust Systems:</strong>
						My project will explore the possibility of adding reliability features to a component-based operating system, specifically adding component reboot capabilities to Composite, a research operating system written by Gabriel Parmer. Because all components in Composite communicate with each other through a well-defined interface, we can peek at the information passing between components and add some capabilities to ‘reboot’ a component back to a useful state.

						<strong>Bio:</strong>
						I’m a Senior at George Washington University pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.A. in Mathematics. My academic interests in said fields lean towards the more practical side of CS and the more theoretical side of Math. I’m hoping to continue my studies in a graduate program in either Computer Science or Computational Finance.					</p>
