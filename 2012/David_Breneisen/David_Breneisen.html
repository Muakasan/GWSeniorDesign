						<strong>Handy Chem-An Automated Grading Tool For Chemistry:</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						Handy Chem uses handwriting recognition in order to GRADE chemistry homework and tests. Teachers set up questions with an answer key by writing a structural formula that Handy Chem reads. Then students answer those same questions and Handy Chem matches the teacher's answer key with the student's response.

						<strong>Bio:</strong>
						I am a student in Computer Science at GWU with an interest in applications of machine learning. I enjoy cycling and backpacking, both as hobbies and for transportation. I also garden in my spare time and someday hope to combine computer science with urban agriculture.
