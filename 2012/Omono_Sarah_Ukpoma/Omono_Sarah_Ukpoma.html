						<strong>uTalk, iShop-Virtual Shopping Made Fun:</strong>
						The unique quality about this site stems from shopping vocally. The user will tell the avatar what he/she wants and the avatar will implement it on the site. In other words, the avatar becomes a user interface between the user and the site.

						<strong>Bio:</strong>
						Hello. My name is Omono Ukpoma and I am a senior at the George Washington University. I was born and raised in Nigeria, came to the United States for college about three years ago and I am currently working on my senior design project. What made me decide to be an engineer? Well, there is a story behind this decision. When I was a kid, I fell in love with a game called The Sims. I found this game extremely interesting and entertaining; so naturally, my curiosity of its makings began to grow. I started asking myself “how are the characters in this game made?”, “how is it that these characters can move?” and so many other questions.					</p>
