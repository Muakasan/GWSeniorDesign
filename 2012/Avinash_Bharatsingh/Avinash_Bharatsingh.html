						<strong>Maestro-Interact With Your Music:</strong>
						Maestro is an interactive music conducting program. Anyone can control any song as a conductor would control the orchestra. This will happen in an authentic conducting environment where the conductor can create their own gestures to conduct the music. They will be able to control the music in the following ways: Volume, Tempo, Pitch, Echo, Flange, Distortion, Chorus, Highpass/Lowpass.

						<strong>Bio:</strong>
						My name is Avinash BharathSingh and I am senior receiving my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science at The George Washington University.  I am originally from New York, New York where I attended The Packer Collegiate Institute prior to my undergraduate studies. My interests are computers, music and baseball. Therefore, I am naturally joining two of those interests in my Senior Design Project. I have been listening to music &amp; singing ever since I was young and quickly became fond of technology in school.  When I was young I also began following the New York Yankees and have been a huge fan ever since.					</p>
