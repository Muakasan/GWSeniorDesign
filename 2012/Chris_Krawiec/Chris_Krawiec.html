						<strong>Memory Scheduling-A New Approach:</strong>
						Memory scheduling is a new approach to memory allocation and management that can be applied in environments where the traditional paging approach is not viable. The idea draws inspiration from cpu scheduling and applies a similar mechanism to memory management. Processes can request memory in a fashion similar to the traditional paging approach, however they will be required to aggressively return that memory to the system to prevent the bloat and resource exhaustion often seen under paging.

						<strong>Bio:</strong>
						I currently study Computer Science with a focus in Information Assurance and Security at George Washington University. According to family members I developed a keen interest in disassembling objects and examining their internal workings as soon as I was able to use a screwdriver. This interest has served me well in my studies, driving me to seek a better, more complete understanding of any and all topics placed in front of me.					</p>
