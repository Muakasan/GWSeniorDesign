						<strong>ArticleSense-A Suggested Reading Tool:</strong>
						ArticleSense is a suggested reading tool that helps supplement knowledge. Unlike tradition search engines, ArticleSense takes an article one might be currently reading and figures out what the keywords are and finds similar articles. The program reads the article and finds the keywords, and then calculates the most relevant articles. It chooses the top ten most relevant articles and presents it to the user. ArticleSense uses a machine learning algorithm to better find the keywords and topics in a particular article. Also, the user has the ability to rate the results they get, in order to get better results in the future. <br><br>

						<strong>Bio:</strong>
						My name is Pooja Agrawal and I’m currently a senior at The George Washington University. I’m seeking a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Information Systems. I am heavily involved with many organizations on campus like the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM), The Society of Women Engineers (SWE), Program Board, The Engineer’s Council, Theta Tau: A professional Engineering Fraternity and Women in Computer Science (WiCS).  I have also held positions in most of the organizations I’m a part of. After I graduate in the spring, I’m looking to forward many things like attending to graduate school, getting a very fulfilling job and traveling the world.					</p>
