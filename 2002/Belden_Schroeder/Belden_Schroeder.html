						 </p><p>This progress report of the software, Amino Pathfinder, will determine the most suitable (unique) amino acid sequence(s) of a protein for antibody production. The software is composed of eight modules that encompass the program's inserted-data handling, processing, and data display. The modules are Amino Acid Sequence Entry Characters, Hydrophilic/Hydrophobic Amino Acid Character Tags, Amino Acid Character User Entry Error Checking, Selected Protein Sequence Request, Compared Protein Sequence Request, Hydrophilic Selected Protein Segment Search, Hydrophilic/Hydrophobic Selected Protein Segment Search, and Exit/Restart Request. The software will be distributed on a CD-ROM capable of being run on a PC with a Windows Me operating system and 64 MB of RAM. </p><p>
