						<strong>SRAS (Software Registration Anitpiracy System):</strong>



						 </p><p>SRAS (Software Registration Anitpiracy System) is a software registration system that lets administrators install and monitor Internet software on web servers. There is a server and client for this product. The server-side handles the installation and monitoring of the software. It processes all information received from the software that is sent periodically. It also allows for the automatic installation of the software once a user has been verified by the system. Another key aspect of the product is the auto updating of the software. Users no longer have to ask for updates but instead have them sent automatically. This also allows the server to monitor who is using the software and where it is being run. On the client side, the user is able to receive auto updates as well as rollback to previous versions if they are not happy with their current one. They also have the option to upgrade to the newer versions located on their machine. Finally, the client periodically contacts the server and reports pertinet information regarding the location of the software being run, the administrator of the software, and variable information to prevent tampering of the license agreement. </p><p>
