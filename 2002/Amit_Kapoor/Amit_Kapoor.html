						<strong>Home HVAC Optimizing:</strong>



						 </p><p>This abstract is for a software product that provides homeowners a way to manage and conserve energy. The software works primarily with an optimization algorithm that takes into account different factors within a home and manages the power supply to save money for consumers. The software will take room sizes, energy bills, and other key factors into consideration in the optimization of the home heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. The system is designed to work on a 400 MHz Pentium II personal computer with a serial bus connection. The hardware HVAC zone controller is developed by Residential Control Systems and communicates over a serial bus to the software. </p><p>
