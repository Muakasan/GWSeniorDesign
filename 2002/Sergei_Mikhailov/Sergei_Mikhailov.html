						<strong>CriticalLoad:</strong>



						 </p><p>CriticalLoad is a program designed to perform load testing on a web application. The key features of the program include: automated agenda creation, easily extendable agenda XML, distributed load generators, extensive tabular and graphical test result representation. CriticalLoad comes as two separate executables, the Controller and the Load Engine. The Controller provides a GUI that allows the user to configure the test, create and modify the test agenda, monitor test progress, and view test results. The Controller should be installed on the computer from which the user wishes to administer the test. The Load Engine is a program that actually generates the load against a web server or an application server. Only one instance of the Load Engine should be installed on a given computer, but there can be any number of Load Engine hosts registered with the Controller. This allows for virtually unlimited load generations capability. While the test is performed, application performance results are collected. At the end of the test, the results are displayed in tabular and graphical form. There are four different tabular and graphical views. </p><p>
