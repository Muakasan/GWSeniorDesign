						<strong>GPS Tour Guide System:</strong>



						 </p><p>This system provides a Global Positioning System based tour guide package for a university allowing users to access pre-installed campus information. The system is location aware, allowing presorted instant access to topics relevant to the user's current location. The system will run on most standard PALM OS PDA systems with an attached standard GPS Receiver device.</p><p>The system provides information through two standard interfaces. The first is the vector based map screen, which plots the user's current position within predefined campus locations. This map is interactive, allowing users to zoom, pan, and click on specific locations to access more in depth information available on a second interface. The second interface provides the user with easy access to all information related to the associated map object. The system software is optimized to provide the most information set possible given its operating environment. The map objects are represented in a vector fashion, allowing a much larger set of data otherwise allowable with standard bitmap representations. </p><p>
