						<strong>Voting System for Federal Elections:</strong>



						 </p><p>The Voting System for Federal Elections is divided into three separate programs, a Server, several Site Servers, and several Voting Machines. The Server initializes the election, and gives statistics to election officials throughout the course of the election. Each Site Server initializes the voting machines at its site, ensures that each vote is accounted for, and sends the site's totals to the Server in a regular fashion. Each voting machine allows voters to edit their votes, and sends each vote to the site server for storage. </p><p>
