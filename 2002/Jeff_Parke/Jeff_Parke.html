						<strong>Face Recognition Software System:</strong>



						 </p><p>The system allows investigators to construct a database of known criminals with associated images. Later, when the investigators have a photo of a suspect that meets certain quality requirements, they can use the system to run a comparison of the suspect's face to the faces of the known criminals in the database. The face recognition system will return the top results to allow the user to determine which image is the best match. The textual information accompanying the image results will allow investigators to quickly learn the estimated accuracy of each result and of any known personal information associated with the criminal. </p><p><img src="jparke.jpg" width="600""></p><p>
