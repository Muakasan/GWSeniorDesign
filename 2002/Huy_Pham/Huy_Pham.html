						<strong>Remote PC:</strong>



						 </p><p>The remote PC is program that will enable the user to connect to another PC and once connected, the remote PC, or the computer that is being connected to, will send an image of its desktop to the user's computer, or local PC. The user will then be able to control the remote PC as if he was actually at that computer. The user will be able to use programs, manipulate files, as well as upload and download files to and from the remote PC. The program will use the TCP/IP protocol to send the information back and forth between the two computers and the Windows Sockets API (Winsock) to provide a socket interface. Windows device handling procedures will be used to access the mouse and keyboard and to acquire their current states (which keys are being pressed, the last coordinates of the mouse, etc.). Image capture will also be done with Windows image handling procedures. Finally, the program will provide security measures to prevent unauthorized accesses.</p><p>
