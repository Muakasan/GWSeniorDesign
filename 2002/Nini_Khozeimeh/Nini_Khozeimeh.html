						<strong>Nini Khozeime:</strong>



						 </p><p>This is the final report for a physical therapy application to work in conjunction with motion capture trackers. The application will allow for a doctor to enter in a regimen for at-home physical therapy of patients. The patient will be able to follow the doctor's regimen and be alerted when errors in the exercise are performed. The Physical Therapy Application also allows for tracking of the patient's exercise through a log file so that the doctor can review the progress. A laptop computer will be distributed with the software pre-loaded. The application is designed to work on any Windows- based machine with the Java Runtime Environment. The system must also contain three Java packages: Java Comm, JavaMail, and Java 3D. The laptop or Windows machine must have a modem so that it can be connected to the Internet. There are five modules in this application: Communications, Patient User Interface, Doctor User Interface, Range of Motion Checking, Storing in the Log File. </p><p>
