						<strong>The Compressed Web Page Browser:</strong>



						 </p><p>This report is a final design review for a universal appointment system for all types of doctors. The system will be written for use on the World Wide Web, with the primary purpose being to minimize and save time spent for both patients and doctors in obtaining a doctor's appointment. Patients will be able to make their own appointments as needed, and cancel an appointment if necessary. One of the key features is that patients will be able to put themselves on a waiting list in the case that they only have time on a certain day to see a doctor, and an opening arises due to another patient canceling.</p><p>The point of the system is to allow people to easily maintain their own schedule for doctors' appointments, and for doctors' offices to reduce their overhead. There are often problems with receptionists not being able to keep up with phone calls and with the patients in the office, and this system seeks to improve that. The system will allow the user to search through a list of doctors by location, health plans that are accepted, specialist, etc. Each doctor will have the accepted insurance plans listed, and doctors can easily find and refer people to a suitable specialist in the area. Patients will be able to post feedback about any doctor for everyone to see, and it will also help the doctors' office improve relations with their patients.</p><p>The total number of hours needed to complete this project is estimated to be 482. The total cost of the project will be approximately $19,635. </p><p>
