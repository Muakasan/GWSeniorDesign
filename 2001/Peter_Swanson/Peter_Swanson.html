						<strong>Restaurant Database and Management System:</strong>



						 </p><p>The restaurant database and management system consists of a database of restaurants that will allow users on the World Wide Web to find information about restaurants in an area, and it also provides management for several host functions. There are two parts to the system: a Web program and a restaurant program. In the Web program, a user searches for a restaurant with certain criteria. Once the user finds a restaurant, the user will be able to view information about the restaurant, view the menu, check the current waiting time, make a reservation, or place a name on the waiting list. In the restaurant program, the host or hostess can keep track of the restaurant's seating chart, reservation list, waiting list, and menu. The host or hostess can also find out the current waiting time, which is computed by the program. He or she can make reservations and add and delete items from the menu. The program informs the user which party should be seated at a table when it is clear. The program also updates the waiting list and reservation list if any users on the Web have added themselves to those lists. </p>
