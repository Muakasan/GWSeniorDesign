						<strong>Space Management Tool (SMaT):</strong>



						 </p><p>The space management tool is an application design to help people in charge of managing physical space, space managers, to try and arrange objects in a virtual room before the actual implementation of their ideas. The tool informs the user if the arrangement of objects is not possible in the given amount of space that has been specified. This tool can be used to store information about building, floor and room layouts, to be retrieved at a later point in time by people looking for space. Information about available rooms can be retrieved in the form of pictures and text. All the information is stored on an Oracle database. Detailed tests were done to meet all of the above specifications. Thus, this tool performs geometric computations to determine whether configurations of geometric objects are valid, and perform computations to store geometric data, and render stored geometric data onto a screen. </p><p>
