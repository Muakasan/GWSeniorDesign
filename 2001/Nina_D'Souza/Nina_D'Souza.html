						<strong>Magic Libre Library Management Tool:</strong>



						 </p><p>Magic Libre, an online library management tool will support patron and librarian functionality. This tool will be developed in Perl and CGI. It will include a validation interface that will differentiate three login levels: patron, librarian, and administrator. The validation interface will include a guest option. Account management, circulation inventory management, and report generation are the main modules for librarians and administrators. Membership services and circulation services are the main modules for patrons and guests.</p><p>The membership services module will allow guests to request for accounts, and patrons to access patron account information as well as profile information. Patrons will be able to view reserved and renewed items, and will be notified of any reasons that the renewing and reserving transactions were canceled on the account if applicable.</p><p>Administrators will be able to manage all account levels: librarians, patrons, and other administrators. Librarians will be limited to managing patron accounts. Administrators and librarians will be able to conduct all transactions within circulation inventory management and report generation.</p><p>The development of Magic Libre will take 36 weeks to complete. The final product will be demonstrated April 30th, 2001. </p><p>
