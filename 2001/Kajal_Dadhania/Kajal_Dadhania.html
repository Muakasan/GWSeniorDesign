						<strong>Web-Enabled Procurement Database:</strong>



						 </p><p>This report contains progress review two for the development a concurrent psychological assessment manager. The transactions will consist of a battery of personality profiling assessments. These assessments will be scored according to the scoring scheme developed by the psychologists of the Strategic Decision Making  Executive Information Systems department of the National Defense University.</p><p>This transaction manager utilizes traffic delivery agents distributed across multiple computers to deliver transactions simultaneously and at varied intervals. The transaction management system handles these assessment transactions generically, and routes them to the appropriate scoring mechanism. Once scoring is completed, the results are inserted into a database where real-time status of population completion can be monitored at any given time.</p><p>This project will require 36 weeks to be completed and an estimated 759 person-hours of labor. The estimated cost for labor is $30,670. A working prototype shall be available by April 25, 2000.</p><p>The estimated cost for the prototype is $103,891. An economic analysis has determined that we will sell approximately 200,000 units of the software at a cost to the company of $0.52 per unit. Estimated retail price of a single distribution is $127.94. Thus far an expenditure of $16,405 has been made to develop this progress review. </p><p>  </p><p>   </p><p>This is the final design report for a Web-Enabled Procurement Database. The Web -Enabled Procurement Database is designed to manage a flat file database. Although this package is designed to manage a procurement database, the management system has a wide range of possible applications. The product consists of three primary components: A web browser also called a Web Client, a HTTP server with a CGI program, and a database server. A database query is initiated by sending a user request from the Web Client to the HTTP server. Upon receiving the user request, the HTTP server invokes the CGI program to assemble user-input data into database-specific statements, and sends them to the database server for processing. The query results will be returned by the database server to the CGI program, and then passed to the Web Client through the HTTP server.</p><p>The three modules are subdivided into smaller modules that perform divided tasks and functions. To provide the database manager software, which will be located on the database server, a cgi script will be written in Pearl. Also, there will be a security module for validation. For the procurement database, 6 modules will be needed. The HTML modules will be located on the HTTP server. The other five will be located on the Database server. The functions that will be supported by this software are as follows: Add, Delete, Modify, View, Search.</p><p>The Web-Enabled Procurement Database will store up to 10,000 records. Each record will be able to support up to 150 attributes (fields). Each attribute will permit up to 256 characters. Starting from August 29th, 1999, the completion of this project will take 36 weeks and will cost approximately $18,865 in 489 person hours of labor. The First Progress Review will be on 1st of December 1999. A working prototype will be available by 26 April 2000. Estimated total cost for the prototype is $63,388. An elementary Economic Analysis has determined that this Web - Enabled Procurement Database will sell about 5,700 units. Each unit is estimated to cost the company $64.32 including indirect labor costs, A  G costs, and a 20% profit. The estimated retail price of each Web-Enabled Procurement Database is $115.77. As of 3 November 1999, $7690 has been spent on the design phase. </p><p>
