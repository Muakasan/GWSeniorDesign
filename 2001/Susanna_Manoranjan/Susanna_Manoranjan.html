						<strong>Products International:</strong>



						 </p><p>Products International consists of e-commerce software serving as a customizable template for any company commercializing in multiple products. The project would provide a ready-made site, where the merchant company handles the supply and selling of its products online. Customers can search and browse an online catalog, and after user verification, order any selected products through secure transactions. To maintain administrative control, the merchant company would be able to customize the web-site, query the database, email prospective suppliers for price quotations, order supplies, and set retail prices for new products. The merchant company, Handicrafts, is selected to demonstrate the software's functionality. This company specializes in unique handicrafts and merchandize from around the world.</p><p>The project is designed in HTML and Java, including Java servlets on the server side. It contains three main modules: (1) Two Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) (2) Java Servlets (3) Database. The first module consists of a customer interface and a merchant company administrative interface. The second module consists of database and general Java Servlets residing on an Apache Server to fulfill all client requests. All database queries, updates, and user verification are serviced by database servlets, while the more general servlets complete tasks of emailing, maintaining shopping carts, and final credit card processing of purchases. The third module consists of an Oracle database of seven tables: customers, orders, suppliers, products, supplies, shopping cart, and employees. </p><p>
