						<strong>Web GradeBook Software:</strong>



						 </p><p>The goal of this project is to build a World Wide Web based GradeBook software. The GradeBook program will be accessed through any HTML browser. The software will be designed for use at the elementary, middle, and high school levels. This program will allow teachers to add, review, and edit grades as well as manage assignment lists. Students will be able to view their grades and continuously monitor their progress throughout the grading period. Both teachers and students will be able to access the grading information as long as they have a World Wide Web browser and an Internet Connection.</p><p>This software package will consist of four main modules: the graphical interfaces, a security module, database modules, and the report manager module. There will be two separate graphical interfaces, one for use by the teachers and one for the students. The security module will protect the sensitive information in the database and grant access only to the appropriate users. The database modules will be the backbone of the software, storing and managing the records with grades, assignments, and student information. The report manager module will organize the information contained in the databases into various useful report formats.</p><p>The project will require 36 weeks to complete and will expand an estimated 515 person-hours of labor at an estimated total labor cost of $20,390. A working prototype of this product will be available by April 26, 2000. Estimated total cost for the prototype is $68,512. Performing a preliminary Economic Analysis has determined that approximately 50,000 copies of the software will be sold. Each copy will cost the company $51.77, which includes indirect, A  G costs as well as 20 % profit. Estimated retail price for this software is $93.19. </p><p>
