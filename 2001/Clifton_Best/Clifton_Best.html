						<strong>Concurrent Assessment Manager:</strong>


						<p>
						This report contains progress review two for the development a concurrent psychological assessment manager. The transactions will consist of a battery of personality profiling assessments. These assessments will be scored according to the scoring scheme developed by the psychologists of the Strategic Decision Making & Executive Information Systems department of the National Defense University.
						</p>
						<p>
						This transaction manager utilizes traffic delivery agents distributed across multiple computers to deliver transactions simultaneously and at varied intervals. The transaction management system handles these assessment transactions generically, and routes them to the appropriate scoring mechanism. Once scoring is completed, the results are inserted into a database where real-time status of population completion can be monitored at any given time.
						</p>
						<p>
						This project will require 36 weeks to be completed and an estimated 759 person-hours of labor. The estimated cost for labor is $30,670. A working prototype shall be available by April 25, 2000.
						</p>
						<p>
						The estimated cost for the prototype is $103,891. An economic analysis has determined that we will sell approximately 200,000 units of the software at a cost to the company of $0.52 per unit. Estimated retail price of a single distribution is $127.94. Thus far an expenditure of $16,405 has been made to develop this progress review.
