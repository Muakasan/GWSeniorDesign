						<strong>Pony:</strong>
						Pony is a source-to-source compiler for C99. In particular, Pony allows users to define "transformations" of the C language. They can then write code in their new "transformed" C, and compile this to ANSI C99. I inherited Pony from Patrick Thomson, a student who graduated from GWU in 2011. This year, I hope to work on allowing pony to be used by someone with no knowledge of Haskell, which Pony is written in. Currently, Pony requires all transformations to be written in Haskell, and all transformations that require a parser require Pony to be recompiled. Both of these are on my plate this next year.

						<strong>Bio:</strong>
						About me I am a senior student in Computer Science and Mathematics at GWU. My main interests are in foundations: both those of computing and mathematics. I'm especially interested in formal languages, including programming languages and compilers.					</p>
