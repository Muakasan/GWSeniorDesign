						<strong>Bio:</strong>
						Hello! My name is Johnny Carmona and I am a senior at GWU's School of Engineering and Applied Science studying Computer Science. I was born and raised in Newark, NJ and began formally exploring my interest in the field of Computer Science while at boarding school in Massachusetts.  My senior design was inspired by my love of music. Project Description: My senior design project is called Motion Music! It is meant to be a tool for musicians to practice and experiment with their sound when they are away from their fellow musicians or are a solo artist. It tracks your motion as you play guitar to generate music to play along with you using 4 different instruments and music that can be customized.
