						<strong>AutoCode-An Automatic Programming Tutorial:</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						It's Automatic will be a programming tutorial aimed at teaching general programming concepts focusing on four major areas: variables, loops, conditionals, and arrays. Users will be able to have access to unique exercises and programming problems that are automatically generated by the program. There will different levels of difficulty for users of different programming backgrounds and users will be able to program in several different languages. The focus is not to teach a specific language but rather fundamental programming concepts and then assess a user's understanding of these concepts.
