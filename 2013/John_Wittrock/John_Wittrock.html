						<strong>CERTOS:</strong>
						CERTOS (Component-Encapsulated Real-Time Operating System) is a novel means to combine the benefits of both real-time and general-purpose operating systems onto a single machine. CERTOS is based on Composite, a research operating system being developed here at GW, and which is a microkernel component-based OS. This allows for interesting interactions between Composite and a real-time OS such as FreeRTOS running on top of it. CERTOS can allow FreeRTOS to still make real-time guarantees, and do dynamic checkpoint and restore of an entire operating system in about 100 microseconds.

						<strong>Bio:</strong>
						About me I’m originally from New York City, and attended Stuyvesant High School there. In my free time I enjoy rowing, sailing, rock climbing, and reading, mostly about systems design recently. I’m currently a senior at George Washington University, majoring in Computer Science (big surprise), with a concentration in systems and security. I’m also the Vice President of the ACM chapter at GW, as well as a member of the Tau Beta Pi honors fraternity. Most recently, I’ve been working at AppNexus’ AdServer team as an intern this summer–I got a great exposure to scalable systems design and implementation, and had a great time while doing it. I was working on a firm-realtime decisioning and adserving system. 				</p>
