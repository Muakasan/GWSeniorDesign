						<strong>NeuralCam-An Accessible Webcam Controller :</strong>
						NeuralCam is an accessible system that allows a user with severe motor disabilities to control a mobile webcam. The system consists of an EEG headset, which scans the user's brainwaves to gather input and issue commands, as well as a webcam mounted on a mobile stand, which will receive these commands. The user will issues commands through the EEG headset to control the tilt, pan and zoom of the mobile webcam, which will allow them greater ability to observe their surroundings, which may not have been easily accomplished without such assistance.

						<strong>Bio:</strong>
					My name is Tyler Kaczmarek, I am a senior majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics at The George Washington University. I intend on attending graduate school upon completion of my bachelor's program in computer science at The George Washington University, and my goal is to attain a Ph. D. in computer science. My main non-academic extracurricular interest is rugby, though I am also involved in several academic clubs, most notably the GW chapter of the Association of Computing Machinery, of which I am the chapter's treasurer. 				</p>
