						<strong>ConTextual:</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
					ConTextual is a software application that bridges the gap between information acquired through real world experience - magazines, advertisements, menus, museum exhibits, receipts, bills, shopping lists - and information acquired through the internet - directions, google searches, movie timings, organizational websites, online shopping, social networking. By snapping photographs of the surrounding environment, users are concurrently creating a 'browser history' of their everyday lives. Using this history, users can upload these images into ConTextual and perform tasks such as internet searches and text consolidation on the text acquired from the image.

						<strong>Bio:</strong>
						I am currently a senior at The George Washington University pursuing my BS in Computer Science. I am originally from Seattle, WA where I lived for 8 years before going to college. My hobbies include playing the guitar and writing music, which I have been doing for the past 13 years. Additionally, I am currently a cadet in Georgetown University's Army ROTC program, through which I will commission as an active duty Signal officer in the United States Army.
