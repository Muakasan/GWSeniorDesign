						<strong>Robo Diet Coach-My Project Will Help You Become a Healthy Eater:</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						The Robo Diet Coach is a program that can help you manage your diet. You can take a snapshot of your meal and the virtual robot will give you feedbacks and recommendations based on the nutritional values of the food presented. In addition, the Robo Diet Coach will maintain a diet history of you. The history will be anaylized to help you develop healthy dietary habits. <br><br>
						<strong>Bio:</strong>
						Hello, my name is Ke Sun. I am currently an undergraduate senior at the Engineering School of the George Washington University. I am pursuing a B.S. degree in Computer Science and a minor in Public Health as well. I am originally from China. I am fortunate to have grown up in different countries, including UK and the United States. The experience has broadened my perspective and interests. Over the years my passions for computer science and medicine have grown tremendously. It is the reason why I am working on a health-related senior design. 		</p>
