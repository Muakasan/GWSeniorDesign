						Welcome! MoWBEE, or Mouse-less Web Browsing Entertainment Experience allows users to control their web browsers solely using hand gestures.  The hardware required for the system includes the Xbox Kinect, a three dimensional camera, and a personal computer that is compatible with the sensor and web browser.  What makes MoWBEE unique is that it can run on any operating system that supports Java, Mozilla Firefox, and the Xbox Kinect.  Having the ability to operate cross-platform gives the system appeal to a wide array of users with different needs and preferences.  The software combines libraries that communicate with the Kinect and web browser to produce a web browsing experience without the need for using a mouse. <a href="http://youtu.be/vyifMIjmGnA"><img src="http://capstone.cs.gwu.edu/2012/jefflevy/files/2012/01/Kinect.jpg" alt="" width="165" height="106" /></a>Click on the picture to view my pitch.<br><br>
						<strong>Bio:</strong>
						My name is Jeff Levy and I am currently a senior at the George Washington University.  My major is Computer Science with a concentration in General Business.  I chose GWU because of the numerous internship opportunities.  Additionally, the idea of a senior project created what I thought would be a very unique experience to explore my interests within the computer science discipline.Ever since I began playing Reader Rabbit on my grandparents' MS-DOS computer at the age of three, I have been very interested in technology.  As I grew older and technology evolved, my interests in the industry have changed as well.  My passion began with personal computers and has grown to include newer technologies, including cell phones, tablets, solar panels, and electric cars.  When I graduate from GW, I would love to work with either cell phone or electric car technology.
