						<strong>Text For All Ages-Mobile Adult Literacy:</strong>
						Text for All Ages is a software application developed for mobile phones or tablets, the fastest growing segment of digital technology. The software application allows adults to read news articles in their chosen category while artfully inserting small exercises along the way to test comprehension. Before the article is presented to the reader, it is simplified automatically to their current reading level, a key algorithmic contribution in this project. The Text Simplification Algorithm developed in this project focuses on sentence reconstruction and synonym replacement to reduce the reading difficulty of a news article. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/AiQLKs3.png">Poster</a>

						<strong>Bio:</strong>
						I am a student at The George Washington University working towards a BS in Computer Science with a minor in Communications.  In addition to my coursework, I have also conducted research funded by the National Science Foundation and worked under the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship program at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, MD. Before relocating to Washington, DC, I spent my time in New Jersey.  In my free moments, I enjoy ballet, running, and reading.					</p>
