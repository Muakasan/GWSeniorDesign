						<strong>Project ARIES:</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
					ARIES is a small, man-portable, VTUAV system in which an operator carries the drone into the field and deploys it to aid in the search for lost hikers. The operator, using a control device, pilots the ARIES drone around a search area while the drone’s edge-finding capabilities, paired with its downward-facing camera, will enable the operator to fly intelligent search patterns. The operator will rely on the drone to alert him to the presence of symbols left on the ground by anyone in the woods as well as identify the meaning of the symbol. <br><br>

						<strong>Bio:</strong>
						My name is Doug Melvin. I am a Computer Science student at The George Washington University in the School of Engineering and Applied Science. I am originally from Rye Brook, New York. After coming to college, I joined the Theta Tau Fraternity, the nation’s foremost fraternity for engineers. From April 2012 to April 2013, I was the Vice-Regent of the Gamma Beta Chapter here at GW. I have worked in professional environments since the summer following 7th grade when I was hired as a summer intern at The Princeton Review’s K-12 division which is responsible for developing textbooks and learning materials for elementary, and secondary, education and state exams.
						<br><br>
						My next two summers were spent working in the Print division, responsible for all their self-branded publications as well as company promotional materials. I was assigned to work on a new book for high school students about career possibilities sorted by the amount of paperwork required. Following that, I tried my hand at a “regular kid” job and became a camp counselor. I felt that the job was a physical challenge, but caring for toddlers and young elementary school children is not a mental challenge in and of itself. During my junior year of high school, I applied for an internship at a managed service and data colocation company close to home called Another 9. I worked there throughout that school year and into the summer, and I have worked there every summer since which made the summer of 2012 my fifth year working with the company.			</p>
