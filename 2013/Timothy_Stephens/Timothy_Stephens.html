						<strong>MARRC-MULTIPLE AUTONOMOUS REMOTE ROBOT COORDINATION SYSTEM:</strong>
						A design project byThe MARRC system is a robotic task/responsibility assignment system to allow a group of robots to work as a cohesive unit towards a common goal.<br><br>The MARRC system began as an idea to cooperatively map an area. As the project progressed, it shifted to a different angle. The current design scheme of the MARRC System will be to fulfill a security protocol, with emphasis on error recovery. This means that all MARRC-bots in the system will cooperatively cover an area, emulating the actions of a personal security team. When one "breaks" (sends an error code, or shuts down), the others will respond and cover the region previously covered by the broken MARRC-bot. At a signal, as if a gun were fired upon the security team's protected asset, the MARRC-bots will converge on that asset and cover it to a designated extraction point.<br><br>UPDATE:<br><br>MARRC System is implemented as a mapping protocol, with potential security applications. Path tracking and obstacle detection are in place so that other protocols could be added if desired.Below are two pictures of a single MARRC-bot, the platform the MARRC system will run on. Each MARRC-bot consists of an iRobot Create, a netbook, and a webcam. The system will be able to run in either configuration, netbook open or closed.

						<strong>Bio:</strong>
						I am a Senior in the Computer Science Department in the School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) at The George Washington University in the heart of Washington, DC. Originally from Vermont, I graduated from high school accepted to Union College in New York, set on majoring in computer science, but not yet ready for college. So I migrated from the cold north to Hawaii for a few months, where I worked on a coffee farm while choosing the direction I wanted my life to take. After I came back to the continental US, I began my college career at Union, but discovered that it wasn't the place for me. I entered GWU as a Sophomore, and instantly took to the greater challenge presented by the CS Program here. Now, as a senior, I get to realize every 10-year-old boy's dream: I get to play with robots for a year					</p>
