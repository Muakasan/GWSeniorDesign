						<strong>IsolOS:</strong>
						The purpose of the project is to explore the feasibility of providing isolation between multiple operating systems running under different subsets of processor cores. The project will utilize the Linux OS and Composite OS. We want to allow Composite to run predictably, with respect to real-time systems. To achieve this, we will need to enforce isolation of the two OSes, allthewhile still enabling Composite to leverage the pre-existing functionalities of Linux, such as device drivers.

						<strong>Bio:</strong>
						About me My name is Yang Yang Wu and I am currently a senior in the GWU Computer Science department. I came from New York and began attending GWU in 2009, originally as a Computer Engineering major, but swapped to CS late freshman year. I have varied interesets in CS, from newfound interests including systems and policies in the CS field to software development and debugging. In my spare time, I try to keep up with technology news through blogs (e.g. Ars Technica, Verge, etc.) and read various materials from books to NIST documentation. Currently I'm in the middle of "The Detachment", by Barry Eisler and various NIST docs. 			</p>
