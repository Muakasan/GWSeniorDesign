						<strong>Homework 2 Personal Scholar:</strong>
						Homework 2 Personal Scholar (A literature research tool) This project combines optical character recognition and backend text searching. Mount a device (tablet with camera) atop a piece of paper. The device images the paper, displays it on its own screen, and turns the text from the paper into hypertext. Provide dictionary links, links to references, wikipedia articles, reviews, etc. The program should also accept any sort of pdf image, as well as scans of written text and be able to convert it into standard computer text, as well as still adding links and such. The final demo should have three applications: one for phones, one for tablets, and one for computers. The demo would begin by showing a document or page of text to the item’s camera and having it loaded to a server. The server backend would then go over the image and use character recognition to turn the image into text. The same could be done from imported images from the web, such as pdfs you need to read for a class, or a page from a textbook (though in this case, it would also have to recognize the images on the page and keep them there). The backend would also do some sort of web search on the words, and ignore the most common words (because that would get repetitive). Each highlighted item should then open a bubble on scrollover to reveal all pertinent information. Microsoft word has the ability to turn most formatted pdf image-text into regular text ( <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Edit-a-Scanned-Document">http://www.wikihow.com/Edit-a-Scanned-Document</a> ). A lot of tablets also have the ability to recognize handwriting. Another tool, this one web based, is Free-OCR (<a href="http://www.free-ocr.com/">http://www.free-ocr.com/</a>).  A higher end tool is something like OmniPage, which has far more features (<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1435434,00.asp">http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1435434,00.asp</a>) I don’t believe there is a tool that parses all these words, so I believe that is the most unique part of the project. This project is interesting because it has vast applications for students and scholars everywhere, to helping them learn more about a subject, and learn it faster instead of wasting time searching for the information they need. If you can scroll over every odd word in your readings and have it tell you what it means immediately instead of having to stop your reading process and search for it somewhere, it’s already benefitting the students who wouldn’t bother with that extra work anyways, and instantly improve their understanding of the subject. As far as scholars go, having a few links to different articles from a word or phrase will let them browse those pages quickly, seeing if any useful information is hidden there. The main APIs I will be using will involve search engines and library databases. Those are the services I will be using to bring extra information into the fold. The most useful will probably be creating custom Google searches (<a href="http://code.google.com/apis/customsearch/">http://code.google.com/apis/customsearch/</a> ) to find any and all relevant information. I’ll also be using plenty of objective C and Java to code for both Android and iPhone environments, which are the main systems of smartphones and tablets. The main components are the text scanner, which I could try to write by myself (but probably not) or figure out a way to incorporate a high-end OCR like Omnipage, and the backend server parser, which would recognize which words/phrases stand out and should be highlighted. The APIs would be used by the parser to find the relevant material, which is probably the most import aspect of the system. The algorithm I’m most worried about is the system that identifies words and picks the proper things to display and link to. Any words that have more than one meaning will need to be identified and have the correct meaning chosen, which will require a parsing of the entire sentence to see how it is being used. Another possibly difficult algorithm is the actual image-to-text process which I have only a vague idea of how to proceed with at the moment. It should be able to work for any font and any size, but while you’re recognizing typed words, why should written words be excluded? Different parsing measures should also take into account the importance of bold and italic words, seeing them as different from everything else, and possibly requiring extra attention. In the next month, more APIs and other possible systems need to be analyzed to see what would best together and would be most efficient, and give me the most desired results. I need to test some OCR packages to see how efficiently they work, and if it’s worth the cost to utilize the not-free OCRs. Also: how to properly use Google to search for things, without having an overload that would get the IP of my server blocked by Google for query overload. My project is going to win the Best Senior Design Award because it’s something every student and teacher can use, and having not based on one operating System makes sure that anyone can use it. We all have to take our humanities courses, and how much easier is it to do readings when some extra background information is accessible with a click? Or even the simple benefit of having your pdf reading ctrl-f searchable so you can find that quote you would spend ten minutes trying to pinpoint? This project is implementable by everyone and everything that assists in learning, which would make it very important to serious scholars (especially if it implements library databases, and if permissions allowed me to search e-books for information, that way I could link to them and potentially advertise them for their retailers). The next step in reading on your tablet is here. And it’s your Personal Scholar.
