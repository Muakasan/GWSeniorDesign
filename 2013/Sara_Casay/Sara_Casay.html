						<strong>CodeSleuth:</strong>
						CodeSleuth allow users to query information about the use of Java from a wide collection of open source Java projects. The user inputs a structural query about the code they are looking for using the query language developed specifically for this project, and either receives the matching code or a number depending on the information requested.

						<strong>Bio:</strong>
						I am a senior at George Washington University majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Theory and Algorithms, and minoring in Mathematics. When I am not in DC, or have a rare free weekend during school, I am in Gaithersburg, MD with my family. I have one younger brother and two younger sisters, so there is always something going on. My hobbies, or basically all the things that I wonâ€™t have much time for this year, include playing soccer, reading, and watching movies.	</p>
