						<strong>MathRomp:</strong>

						My senior design project, MathRomp, is a mobile social app that turns mathematics into a fun, competitive game. Through the game, users will be able to solve various math problems of different difficulty levels and, subsequently, challenge their friends to solve those same problems. In addition, the app will also provide a platform for teachers and professors to be able to create specific groups of users, their students, and program specific assignments and problem sets for them to complete.

						<strong>Bio:</strong>
						About me My name is Mary Fredman and I am currently a senior in the School of Engineering and Applied Science at The George Washington University. I am working towards a Bachelor of Arts degree in Computer Science with minors in Mathematics and Film Studies. I was born in Columbus, Ohio and have lived there my entire life with the exception of three years in which I was living in Hong Kong, China. The most significant job I have had thus far was at M/I Homes where I interned for two consecutive summers. There, I worked in the marketing department on content management for the company’s website. I was also responsible for coding and sending out all of the company’s emails which involved programming in HTML and XML. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wdurduskm2jqdp0/website_pic.jpg">Me</a>					</p>
