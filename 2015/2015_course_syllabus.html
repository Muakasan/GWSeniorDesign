							<li>Learn key elements in the development of a significant year-long computer science project: planning, specification, design, analysis, and implementation.</li>
							<li>Apply concepts from software engineering to the project: requirements, specification, reuse, documentation, verification and <li>validation, testing, configuration management</li>
							<li>Learn to write about and practice presentations about important aspects of the project: the case for launching the project, status reports, design, and implementation plan.</li>
							<li>Demonstrate a working project.</li>
							<li>Demonstrate an understanding of how knowledge and skill in computer science courses played a role in the project.</li>
							<li>Demonstrate an understanding of how continuing education can contribute to career development.</li>
							<li>Explore issues related to local and global impact of computing, as well as social impact issues.</li>
							
						</ul>

						Textbook:
						<ul>
							<li>There is no official textbook. Readings will be recommended where appropriate.</li>
						</ul>

						Programming load:
						<ul>
							<li>The course will be fairly programming-intensive, and just intensive in general. If you are taking TWO OTHER programming-intensive courses, you could be in for a rough semester. Stop by and discuss the issue with the instructor.</li>
						</ul>

						Assignment submission and late work policy:
						<ul>
							<li>Late policy: assignments will lose 10% per day during the first 5 days of lateness. After that, you will stay at a constant 50% off until the next assignment is due.</li>
							<li>All reports, presentations and such will be submitted via your project website and/or email.</li>
							<li>The submission time will be determined by the upload time on the project website.</li>
							<li>If you're seeking an extension because you've been ill and have a letter from a doctor, come by and see us about it.</li>
					    </ul>

					    Academic Integrity policy:
					    <ul>
							<li>In this course, you will be expected to work on all assigned coursework by yourself, unless otherwise specified by instructions on this site. If you have any questions whatsoever regarding these policies, see us during office hours.</li>
							<li>You may not, without permission from the instructor, exchange course-related code with anyone (including anyone not registered in the course), or download code for use in your coursework, or use material from books other than the textbook. <li>Likewise, you may not look at anyone else's code or show your code to anyone else. Protect your work: for example, be careful not to leave your printouts around.</li>
							<li>If you use material in your assignments that are from outside the course material, then you should be prepared to explain that material. The instructors and TAs reserve the right to question you on your use of extraneous material. Failure to answer such questions might be viewed as grounds for an integrity violation.</li>
							<li><strong>It is likely that you will use some external libraries or code in your project. You must properly attribute that code to its original source in your comments and documentation. The vast majority of the code specific to your project must be your own; if you are uncertain if you are using too much external code, meet with the instructor.</strong></li>
							<li>The Academic Integrity Code will apply to this course. Please read through the code carefully.
							<li>Penalties for violating the code or the policies described here include failing this course, and are elaborated in the Academic Integrity Code.</li>
					    </ul>
					    If you have a disability that may effect your participation in this course and wish to discuss academic acommodations, please contact us as soon as possible.
