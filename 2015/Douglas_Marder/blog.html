						09/11/2014 21:35: Just taking this opportunity to point out how incredibly annoying, er basic – yeah, that's the ticket – this wiki software is to use. DokuWiki has now elevated Atlassian's Confluence to second place on my most annoying wiki list. No local file docking (i.e., you cannot upload a file to a folder linked to your namespace), horrible table creation tools, and, worst of all, no site navigation (although I think this is an effect of how this tool has been configured for the GW CS Senior Design 2015 class).<br><br> 

						09/11/2014 22:12: Finished my Writing Assignment 1, Grant Proposal Summary Page, submission a few hours ago, but have been thinking about it ever since I started playing around with my wiki pages. I fear I may have bitten off more than I can chew. There are a great number of moving parts here that I have never played with before. This is what I get for letting my coding skills go for almost 20 years.<br><br>

						10/14/2014: Completed Writing Assignment 2, Functional Requirements Document. Very worried about developing a statistical model that will work for this <br><br>

						10/21/2014: Dropped SMP idea due to complexity and length of time required to develop and prove statistical models. Dr. Wood and I have reviewed other options. I have elected to go with a virtual notebook application. Will see if I can get Google Glass from SEAS, or go with separate video, photo and voice recording devices. <br><br>

						10/29/2014: Am officially a glasshole. Picked-up my Glass kit from SEAS tonight. Been playing around with them until the wee hours. Need to figure out what else I need to make all this work. <br><br>

						11/02/2014: Have a problem with Glass. Need to wear contacts or wear Glass over prescription lenses. Does not fit well over prescription frames. I have a diopter insert for my cycling glasses that works if I can figure out how to keep them steady without a frame to support them. Will probably have to order more contacts. <br><br>

						11/20/2014: Updated project website for Glassnotes project. Completed HW3, Component & Interface Design. Still have a few outstanding items to figure out: can I implement an A/V editing component, and can I import CAD/CAM files and present location-specific details to the user? <br><br>

						11/23/2014 22:50: Completed Writing Assignment 3, business plan. Went a little overboard by completing most of a real business plan template except for the financial management sections. Still working on identifying libraries, widgets and APIs for implementation. Need to rock and roll this week.
