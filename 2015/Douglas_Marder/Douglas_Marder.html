						<strong>Glassnotes:</strong> According to Steve Willinger, business development manager at Google, like the heads-up displays (HUD) used by fighter pilots, wearable computing technologies enable "hands-free computing for hands-on work." By introducing task-related information into the workspace, without interfering with or distracting from the work being performed, these technologies increase the capability and effectiveness of workers. In his keynote address at the recent Google Glass Development Conference, Willinger highlighted four business problems Google Glass can solve: training, task completion verification, business intelligence, and communication.

						Glassnotes addresses all four of these business problems. Imagine a surgeon recording an operation for training new doctors, providing real-time POV to specialists in remote locations; a forensic engineer inspecting construction of a nuclear power plant verifying pipe welds, identifying sources of leaks and corrosion able to visually record the inspection process and augment the recording with dictated notes; or, a factory working assembling a complex and expensive component provided with a checklist and real-time, step-by-step assembly instructions, while quality assurance inspectors observe the worker's POV.

						The Glassnotes notebooks can be used to:

						<ul>
						<li>Train new workers in the tasks performed and recorded;</li>
						<li>Verify proper task completion as documents of record;</li>
						<li>Provide BI back to managers and consumers of the tasks performed and products assembled in the recordings; and,</li>
						<li>Communicate with other workers in real-time via remote viewing of the user's POV.</li>
						</ul>	
						Glassnotes enables the user to create a visual, audio, and text-enhanced notebook to record what the user sees and does while performing a task. Through voice commands, and occasional taps and swipes to the side of the Glass device, a Glassnotes user may record POV video, take a photograph, and record a voice note to record some specific detail. Glassnotes manages and sequences the A/V files and merges them into a single notebook for playback and editing.

						Glassnotes utilizes video, photograph, and audio recording features, along with location, elevation, direction (compass) sensors provided by Glass, links the Glass to another Android OS-based device for short-term storage and playback, and to a user's Google Drive account for long-term file storage. A web browser-based application provides access to the user's saved notebooks for playback and basic editing functions. Additionally, a server based component acts as an intermediary between the Android and web apps to provide file management, merging and time sequencing of the separate video, photo and audio files into a single Glassnotes notebook, and, if the user desires, voice-to-text conversion of all recorded audio.

						Additional functionality that may be delivered with the completed Glassnotes project include:

						<ul>
						<li>Providing location-sensitive information to the user based on objects in the user's POV (on-demand or automatically); and</li>
						<li>Intake and processing of CAD/CAM schematics to provide detailed location-specific information to the user. For instance, a </li>building inspector may find it useful to receive information about a particular structural component as specified in the building design.
						</ul>
