						<strong>Recommended News:</strong>
						Nowadays, an increasing number of News apps coming out and most of them are based on their own platforms. Users mostly need to open one news app and read everything through and go to another app and do the same things again. They do not have the right to read the recommended news they like, so I am planning to design an app called Recommended News which is based on the news we recommend to users on the basis of their preference. After getting information from Facebook login information, we can gather the background information of the user and query news from Google News to show for the user. Furthermore, we can memorize which news read by users and continue to recommend similar news to user. Moreover, we will update the database system to have news recommended according to the news they read. The main challenge we have to overcome is to track some characteristics of the user based on the articles they read, and the app will find other articles that are similar to the ones they liked in the past. While Google gives me a list of news articles based on a simple query like "GWU", however, it will get very confused if some results, such as "GWU iPhone pizza", are going to give strange outcomes. To solve this problem, we need to build a profile of what kinds of article topics user is interested in, and then being able to automatically parse through new articles to determine how well they match what the user cares about. Overall, I need to apply various NLP and ML algorithms to determine what the different articles Google returns are actually about, so you can decide which are most relevant.
