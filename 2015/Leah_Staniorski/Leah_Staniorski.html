						<strong>Flexible Fitness:</strong> I notice in my own busy schedule, as well as my friends' and familys', that it is hard to find the time to develop a fitness schedule that is maintainable. Finding a flexible solution to incorporate fitness into my everyday life has been an ongoing struggle for the duration of my undergraduate career. I many times notice this issue in those around me and see opportunities to fit exercising into every day life slip away. Finding a way to utilize any spare time in any location every day is the goal of Flexible Fitness, a mobile app I hope to create. If each person was able to use this app in order to create a maintainable healthy lifestyle, it would help to improve both their physical and mental health. 
						The user will initially be prompted to enter their current weight, height, gender, and weight loss goal. The goal may be either to maintain weight or to lose weight. The user will be able to plan workouts by entering their time limitations and environmental limitations, which include having access to weights, a step (incline), staircase, and room to run. They also may choose a specific muscle group to focus on, including abdominals, legs, arms, or all. The background database, created with mongoDB, contains exercise information for all of these muscle groups, including the name, required equipment, calories burned per 15 minutes, and muscle group. The user is given a maximum efficiency workout considering their limit and environmental limitations and personal fitness goal. They are able to view this workout plan along with the amount of calories they will approximately burn. There workouts are also saved in the database for the user to go ahead and look at in the future. As a separate feature, the user will also be able view the exercise database and all included information. An example: if the user has only 50 minutes to dedicate to exercising while having a break in his/her office, the app will give the user a plan which maximizes efficiency in that time. If the user has goals to lose weight, this plan will mostly aim to maximize calories burned. If the user has goals to gain weight, this plan will mostly aim to maximum muscle strength. This will allow the user to make the most out of the time that they have to spend on exercising and get them closer to their personal fitness goals everyday. 
						Bio: I am currently completing my final year of undergraduate working towards a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the George Washington University. Upon graduation, I will be working as a Software Engineer at Lockheed Martin in Herndon, VA. The most enjoyable area of this major for me is software development because of the endless possibilities and room for creativity. I have always been an enthusiast of math, so I largely enjoy the mathematical aspect of Computer Science as well. I am a huge advocate of environmental sustainability and do all I can to live accordingly. Originally from Rhode Island, “The Ocean State”, I have a huge appreciation for the ocean and beach. In my free time I enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking, running, canoeing, skiing, kayaking, and going to the beach. I also enjoy a good book.
