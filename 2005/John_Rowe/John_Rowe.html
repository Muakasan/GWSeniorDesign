						<strong>Xoco: An Automated Speech Recognition System:</strong>



						 </p><p>Xoco is speech recognition system that allows for hands-free control of a Windows system. The system is composed of six modules: a GUI, a Recording Unit, a Normalization Unit, a Feature Extractor, a Comparison Unit, and an Updating unit. The GUI initiates sound recording and confirmation of the command to be used, if the system is in training mode. The recording unit simply records the voice command from the user. The normalization unit and feature extractor work to process and identify important features of the sound. The comparison unit calculates the closest command to the one spoken by the user and sends it to the GUI for confirmation and execution. The updating unit, in training mode, tries to ensure that the commands stored by the system previously are accurate. </p><p>
