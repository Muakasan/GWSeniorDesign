						<strong>Contract Email:</strong>



						 </p><p>Contract Email allows for email exchanges to be logged in a secure way, so as to be used in contract negotiations. The project is a modification to the Pine email client which will allow for the encryption and logging of emails. Within the Pine program, contacts can be flagged as Contract. Whenever an email is sent to such a contact, the email will be encrypted (via the Blowfish algorithm) and sent to the mail server. Here, the email is decrypted and logged and then either bounced back to the sender or re-encrypted and sent to the recipient depending on if the recipient has set up an account. A Java stand-alone application allows for searching and reconstruction of past emails that have been sent to/from the user. </p><p>
