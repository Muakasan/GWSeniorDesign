						<strong>Internet Usage Monitor:</strong>



						 </p><p>This project outlines, designs, and builds an Internet usage monitoring program. The program will have three components: the client, server, and viewer. The client component of the program will monitor the local computer by creating a log of the user name, URLs visited, and time spent online. The information captured is transferred to a server component of the program running on a remote machine where it is analyzed and stored in a database. The viewer component of the program also runs on a remote server and provides the means to view information from the database or live from the client program. </p><p>
