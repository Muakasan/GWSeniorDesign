						<strong>Automated Shopper:</strong>



						 </p><p>The Automated Shopper application will allow a person to browse, to view detailed information about merchandise, or to purchase products from a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) device. The development of this tool is comprised of four major modules: User Interface; Client Web Clipping Application (WCA)communications module; Secure Payment module; and Remote Web Server communications module. The user interface contains a series of forms that guide the user through the program. The WCA also known as Palm querying application (PQA) provides a simplified display of HTML pages for small display screens, such as those of PDA devices. The WCA is used to display information extracted from web content to the user. The Secure Payment module provides the secured access and payment verification of the purchase feature. The Remote Web Server provides HTML content to the WCA. The program requires an Internet enabled, Palm OS PDA, with at least 400k of free memory for the WCA application s tore. The server requires at least a 1.0 GHZ processor and 10GB disc space to ensure reliability. A keyboard or stylus can be used as input devices. </p><p>
