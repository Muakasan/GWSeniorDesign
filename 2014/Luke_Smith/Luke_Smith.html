						<strong>Title Here:</strong>1. Figure out where to buy the best quadracopter that will suit my purposes for this project 2. Write a program to manually alter the movements of the quadacopter without using the preprepared software 3. Write a program to have the camera record or collect images that I can use as templates for image processing a. write a program that can do something simple with the image, perhaps out line shapes? 4. Download the OpenCV software and begin experimenting with it a. write a program using this library b. find a way to test this software 5. Start looking for problems I will encounter involving lighting, and imaging processing, perhaps look into security measures that will protect the stored data if the quadracopter is intercepted 6. Decide between C and Java and which one will better serve my purposes. 7. Meet with Doug again and talk about realistic logistics of the project and what I can hope to expect from this a. Possibly ask for a demo from his senior design 8. Find professors who are doing research with robotics and ask for advice on how I might solve problems I might encounter 9. Meet with an advisor and figure what is the most realistic out come of this project 10. Breathe BLT2 I still need to meet with Simha and discuss the information professor provided me. Meet with professor Ben-Tzvi about robotics Start researching true RNG, (lava lamp RNG) Look at different software that has object recognition, and decide on which path I want to go in. I will want it to be autonomous, so start writing psuedocode for basic autonomous function Still need to meet with Doug and see how the camera works 7Plan a possible route or layout map DD1 At the 30% I'd probably have the rng aspect working and having a path ability all worked out At the 70% I think I might have some object recognition working At the 80% Be able to possibly take screen shots from the air for further analysis At the 90% Hopefully I might have these functions working together in some capacity At the 100% Have some sort of database for storing information DD2 At the 30% I'd probably have the rng aspect working and having a path ability all worked out At the 70% I think I might have some object recognition working and hopefully have the device cooperating with this software At the 80% Have everything up to object recognition finished and data storage finished at this point At the 90% Have a database system setup to store information, while working out final details in object recognition At the 100% Hopefully be ready to test
