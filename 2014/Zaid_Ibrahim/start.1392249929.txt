**Theia:** Theia is a 3D rendering application used to create a virtual model of a room by taking pictures of each corner of the room.

**Bio:** My name is Zaid Ibrahim and I am a Senior studying Computer Science with a concentration in Graphic design and  Visual media. After college I hope to go into the animation industry and create characters and environments. Throughout my time here I have gained a growing love for computer science and with my Senior Design project I hope to merge my artistic interests with my technical interests.
