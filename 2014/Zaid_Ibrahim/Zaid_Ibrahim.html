						<strong>Thiea-3D Room Generator:</strong> Theia is an application intended to scan a room and create a 3D representation of that room. A handheld camera will be used to view a room, collect information about objects in the room, and send back this information for the application to draw the room in 3D. The 3D model, along with the room data, will be saved and made available for the user to use and share at their own discretion.

						<strong>Bio:</strong> I am a rising senior studying Computer Science with a concentration in Graphic design and  Visual media. After college I hope to go into the animation industry. Throughout my time here I have gained a growing love for computer science and with my Senior Design project I hope to merge my artistic interests with my technical interests.
