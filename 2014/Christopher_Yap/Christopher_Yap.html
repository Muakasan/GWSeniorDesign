						<strong>FocusEye:</strong> FocusEye is a system that uses eye tracking software to look at how the movement of one’s eyes affects the ability to learn and retain information. By using the Mirametrix eye tracking hardware and system of focus and learning games, FocusEye will provide users with useful and meaningful data about their own or subjects eye movements and how they correlate with how well subjects are retaining the information presented to them. Further, the program aims to test if a subject can train their focus by incrementing the difficulty of the games and tests. If there is a correlation between eye movement and the retention and information, the program will show this by giving data about how long the subject’s eyes are focused on the material.

						<strong>Bio:</strong>My name is Christopher Yap and I am a senior Computer Science Major studying at The George Washington University. My technichal interests include a wide variety of things such as Computer Animation, Computer Graphics, Mobile App Development, as well as many others. I want to use my unique skills and abilities to combine art and entertainment with technology in new and exciting ways.
 
						In my free time I enjoy playing golf, photography, graphic design, competitive gaming and video content creation. Computers have always been a passion for me and has continued with me for my entire academic career and personal life. The final goal for me has always been and will be to make the people happy with the tools and technology I am given or can create.
