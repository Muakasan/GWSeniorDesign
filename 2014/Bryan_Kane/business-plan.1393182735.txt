== EasyRead Business Plan ==

EasyRead, a web-based utility for educators, assists with the simplification of textual content. Users select a target reading level and upload content, which EasyRead then analyzes to identify difficult-to-read sections and produce suggestions for simplifying the material. After making any necessary modifications, EasyRead allows users to submit their changes into the “EasyRead library,” a collection of pre-simplified content, categorized by grade level, and available for immediate use. Upon submission, EasyRead also utilizes advanced pattern-detection algorithms to identify common techniques in simplification, which further trains the EasyRead system.

This system is critically important for elementary school students who lose engagement with decades-old classroom materials, adult learners who are learning how to read and desire more relevant, age-appropriate content, and educators who struggle with finding interesting texts within their students’ reading level. There currently exists a gap between content that is accessible to early readers, and content that is relevant and enjoyable to read.  Students are trapped repeatedly reading antiquated passages from textbooks, while interesting, relevant articles from popular newspapers and blogs sit out of reach due to their complexity.

EasyRead, when combined with recent news stories, blog posts, and magazine articles, allows users to easily transform interesting, but often difficult-to-read, content into content that is both interesting and accessible to early readers.  Through integration with popular news sources and its sophisticated text-analysis engine, EasyRead greatly reduces the time and effort necessary to simplify a piece of text. Without EasyRead, educators who choose to bring relevant content to their students would spend hours breaking content down line-by-line, making decisions, and sometimes guesses, as to what could be understood by their students, and painstakingly modifying their document in order to improve comprehension and readability. However, with EasyRead, this task becomes much simpler and less time consuming, enabling educators to utilize relevant, interesting content in more ways that before.

=== Market Overview ===

The EasyRead system’s primary target market consists of educators responsible for students who are learning to read or are at basic reading levels. This market segment can be further broken down into two primary groups: elementary school educators, and adult-literacy educators. According to the U.S. Census Bureau[1], there are over one million first-, second-, and third-grade teachers in the United States. Due to its large size and potential for adoption, EasyRead considers this market segment as its primary target market, and adult literacy educators its secondary target market.

Further working to EasyRead’s advantage, the market segment of elementary-school teachers is a highly networked group. Not only do these educators see their colleagues on a daily basis, but when they find a tool that simplifies tasks and makes them and their peers more effective, they love to share it. Thus, if one educator in a school hears about and tries EasyRead, the likelihood that other teachers in the school will hear about it is extremely high. Thus, EasyRead will be able to rely heavily on word-of-mouth advertising, reducing advertising and marketing costs.

However, these marketing costs will still exist. Instead of wildly spending on advertising, though, there will only be a few targeted forms of advertising necessary. The most important means of advertising will be through print ads in //Education Week//, a magazine targeted towards teachers with a print readership of over 50,000[2] and online readership of 750,000. This ultra-focused circulation means that the return for each dollar spent for advertising will be much higher than a general publication, as every single reader of the magazine is a potential user.

=== Technical Overview ===

EasyRead, with the assistance of many open-source libraries and frameworks, is a highly sophisticated and thorough platform. Broken down into two categories, the EasyRead //helper// and the EasyRead //learner//, the system is both able to assist users with the simplification of text and learn from users’ techniques, to be better able to provide suggestions and replacements in the future.

The EasyRead //helper//, the web-based tool that assists users with simplification, makes use of years of research from Stanford University with the //Stanford NLP Parser//. This parser provides advanced analysis of sentence structure, providing insight into the way that sentences are formulated, and allowing the seamless reconstruction of sentences without losing any meaning or content.

The //helper// also makes use of the Princeton University WordNet, an advanced database of the English language that includes definitions, frequency counts, relationships between tenses, and additional categorization for every word. With this resource, EasyRead can make word and replacements, reducing the difficulty of a passage without losing any meaning.

The EasyRead //learner// works hand-in-hand with the //helper//, using the simplified content that is created by users through the //helper// to better train the text-analysis system. While the EasyRead system uses advanced techniques to detect complicated areas and offer suggestions, the number of patterns and replacements that it can detect are finite, while the English language has an infinite number of patterns and formats. When a user makes a change to a document that isn’t originally suggested by EasyRead, the //learner// can identify the changes that are made. If enough users make a similar change, which could be anything from replacing a single word with another to splitting sentences and phrases up into different orderings, the //learner// will identify these patterns and use them in the //helper// to propose these changes to future users.

In order to accomplish this, the learner will utilize advanced machine-learning implementations to analyze the large collection of documents available, finding patterns between source documents and simplified documents. Through the //EasyRead library//, users will receive an incentive to submit their modifications back to EasyRead, allowing the system to utilize its community and become more useful with its growth, automatically.

=== Social Impact ===

EasyRead has the potential for a large worldwide social impact, by helping teach literacy to those who would otherwise be uninterested or confused when learning how to read. Worldwide, the global literacy rate is only 84.1%, and of those considered illiterate, over two-thirds are women[3]. These figures are extremely daunting, and show a large imbalance of potential in a society. If EasyRead can make it easier for one-tenth of 1% of the world’s illiterate population to learn how to read, that would mean that almost one million people around the world can now find it easier to live their daily lives and have a much higher potential for advancement in society.

While EasyRead is being independently developed currently, there exists a potential for expansion in the development team, perhaps even to other countries for development. Given the connected nature of the internet, remote work is now extremely easy to initiate, and in many cases can reduce costs and bring a global outlook towards product development. However, EasyRead must always remember to be respectful of other cultures and beliefs, and any obligations or restrictions that come along with those.

=== Ethical Considerations ===

While EasyRead appears to be a purely net-positive product, users can potentially misuse the platform, which could lead to ethical considerations. The first, and largest, consideration is the topic of plagiarism. The possibility exists for a user to input an article, make modifications, and then distribute the modified article without giving any credit or attribution to the original source. This is a large problem, as it could result in facts, or misrepresentations of content, being distributed without a full trace of history or sources. Additionally, despite any modifications made, taking an original work and redistributing it without attribution is wrong, and in many cases, illegal.

Another possible ethical consideration is how EasyRead may widen the effects of the digital divide. Since EasyRead is a web-based platform, it is only accessible to users who already have access to a computer and the internet. Thus, the effects of EasyRead, including the potential for greater literacy levels and an increase in the ease of learning how to read, can only be felt by those who already are in an environment where they have technology / internet access. Those without access to a computer will only fall behind farther in literacy education.
