						<strong>Augmented Reality, Kinect, Wii Fit, Body Composition, Physical Therapy:</strong> MyPT is game based ACL physical therapy device. MyPT will assign appropriate physical therapy exercises to the user, in game form. The 3D Kinect camera will track movements to collect information from the user, that will be able to correct and advise movement in real time, but also track improvement overall to progress the rehabilitation. Since physical therapy can be a long process often not covered by insurance to completion, MyPT will allow additional and easy to access physical therapy to those who need it, but also to those who want to have a better time doing it.
