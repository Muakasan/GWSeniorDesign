						<strong>Owl-Sight Secure:</strong> Owl-Sight Secure is a test-monitoring system that insures exam integrity for online test-taking. It will give you a cheat-proof exam-taking environment while students will have the freedom to take the test anytime and anywhere. Owl-Sight Secure monitors testing irregularities by video and audio through webcam and through disabling external programs to the test.
