**Sirius** is a steganography-enabled broadcasting agent.

**Bio:** <HTML> <p>I am Thomas Aslan Ballas, an undergraduate computer science student of the George Washington University.  
I was born and spent the first 18 years of my life in Los Angeles, CA.  In 2010, I moved to DC and now reside in Arlington.  
Outside of my classes, I enjoy running, reading articles on Reddit, and learning new things.  
When I can, usually a few times each year, I enjoy scuba diving and recently went on my first wreck dive.  
<br><br>
My professional interests lie in the field of cybersecurity and information assurance.  
To this end, I was awarded and am now a student of the NSF Scholarship for Service: CyberCorps.  
In accordance with its guidelines, this summer, I worked at the Dept. of Health and Human Services on an IT Security team.  
My senior design project is related to my professional interests, specifically, steganography.</p>
