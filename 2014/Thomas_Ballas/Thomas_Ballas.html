						<strong>Steganographic Relay System:</strong> The Steganographic Relay System is an application that allows its users to embed messages within images. These images are uploaded to social networking or media sharing sites that our server has recorded. Once uploaded, our server retrieves these images, extracts the message, and relays it in plaintext to its audience outside the reach of those who may wish to tamper with it or trace its origin.

						<strong>Bio:</strong>: I am Thomas Aslan Ballas, an undergraduate computer science student of the George Washington University.  My professional interests lie in the field of cybersecurity and information assurance.  Outside of my classes, I enjoy running, reading articles on Reddit, and learning new things.  My project is related to my professional interests, more specifically, steganography.
