					This project is called E-Quote, a Stock Market Analyzer. It will allow users to see different information pertaining to stock-markets in an organized and readable fashion. For this project, a query language will be designed and an interpreter will be created. The query language and interpreter will intrepret and output information pertaining to different stock markets using a statistical package influenced by SAS. A database will also be used to display output of this project.

My specific interest in Computer Science is Database Management and Security. I currently work at the George Washington University Libraries where I gained experience working on a digitization project for IMLS (Institute of Museum and Library Services). In my spare time, I like to read, watch movies, and cook new recipes.
